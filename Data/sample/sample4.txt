At Paragon, the oldest restaurant in the Pearl, general manager Bryan Westacott favors walk-in applicants. The comfort-food brasserie gets four to six job seekers a day dropping off résumés lately, Westacott said, up from one or two a day last year. And 70 percent have college degrees.

Instead I pulled my laptop out from the desk and sat in bed doing some research on lost dogs. It didn’t take me long to find and article from a local newspaper with the dramatic headline: ‘Pampered Pooch Presumed Dead’. It was from the village to the East, about two miles away, and it detailed the loss of a West Highland Terrier bought by two wealthy parents for their spoilt teenage daughter; at least, that is how I read it. Apparently the dog had gone missing almost a month ago and there was a large reward for any information on his whereabouts.

Comes the Night is the author’s second novel. Her first Vicious Spring, appears to be similarly dark, although leavened with humour, following the sexual awakening of a school-leaver from a Christian fundamentalist family on an acid trip. It sounds equally compelling.
Our neighbor’s baby was full term. She was 3 months old. She had been to the pediatrician the day before. She had been taking a nap. She did not wake up. I did not know that Jake would die. However, I knew he was very premature and he had hydrops. I knew that he was in the NICU and there were complications. Our neighbor thought she was waking up her baby to take her to her first Christmas party.

Since the law was passed, it's been clear that it was both mean-spirited and likely to lead to racial profiling and discrimination. But it is also a clear preemption of federal power. For example, SB 1070 requires that police check the immigration status of anyone they stop in the course of their work and whom they suspect of being in the country illegally, even those pulled over for routine traffic violations. If that person can't provide documentation, he or she may be detained. The law also authorizes police, who have received no training in the complexities of immigration law, to carry out arrests without warrants if they suspect that an individual has committed a deportable offense. The problem is that Arizona doesn't have the authority or ability to make deportation determinations. That burden would ultimately fall to federal officials, who would be forced to shift resources from their top priority — deporting immigrants with criminal records — in order to deal with people who have been detained merely because they are suspected of being here illegally. That hardly makes for the kind of sensible "cooperation" between state and federal law officers that has been authorized by Congress.
Woohoo kicked this colds ass! I credit it all to superfood and airborn. Busy week too so it's a damned good ting man.

Ripples from the choirs travel far. In 2009, the American Choral Directors Association invited the Pacific Youth Choir to sing at its 50th anniversary convention in Oklahoma City. The invitation was the equivalent of a youth soccer team going to the nationals. Afterward, choir member Carolyn Cruze wrote a college application essay about her reaction to visiting the city's memorial to those who died in the bombing of the Federal Building.
Sounds like an odd pairing at first, but perhaps not: What two actors of the time better personify their respective countries and their approaches to film, with the classically trained Olivier an English icon of stage and screen, the bombshell Monroe a huge movie star? Of course, she was also intensely devoted to Lee Strasberg and the Method school of acting. It sounds like a combustible mix that could maybe result in something special.
The Bank of Edwardsville donated about an acre for the site, Pagano designed the memorial and a $42,500 state grant and private donations paid for it The centerpiece is a monument, flanked by sculptures of a soldier's boots, rifle and helmet.

We somehow have the idea that fear is irrational and shouldn't be heeded. Everything's fine, we lie when common sense screams DANGER! (This applies to comfortable settings, as well, such as during church services.) We should feel uncomfortable when a man gets into our personal space. Don't let him in! We should feel suspicious and distrustful when some suave guy starts asking personal questions and gives us that dashing, disarming smile. We should feel fear! God gave us the feelings of discomfort, suspicion, distrust, and fear for a reason. Do you think Joseph might have felt those feelings just before he RAN from Potiphar's wicked wife? Don't turn those feelings off; listen and obey!

St. Louis Circuit Judge John Garvey last month sided with Tamara Favazza in her suit against Mantra Films Inc. and MRA Holdings LLC, awarding her $5.77 million. She was a 20-year-old college student in 2005 when someone lifted her tank top during a party at a St. Louis bar, exposing her breasts. Another person filmed it. She later discovered the recording was part of the "Girls Gone Wild Sorority Orgy" DVD series.

Back in the Biscoff heyday of a few months ago, I purchased a jar with the intent of baking up a Biscoff storm (this a was a big deal since it was one of those specialty ingredients I just mentioned). Little by little, the spread diminished until I was left with a scant quarter cup (no surprises there - it's delicious!) . I was determined to finally bake with it, and these bars were the result.

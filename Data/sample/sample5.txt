Let me just say this, if you were to return home to your kids at 6:55 AM and your husband was on the phone with Poison Control, there is no way you would react the way that Lauren did. She was calm, cool, and collected. She listened with patience as I told her all that had happened. She only gave me the "you are an idiot" eye-roll once. Okay maybe twice. The nurse neighbor showed up a few minutes later and gave me the "you are an idiot" eye-roll several times. She checked Jackson's vitals and made us feel better. We observed Jackson for the next two hours and finally relaxed when we knew he was going to be okay.
When maturity of the mind comes before maturity of the heart, you are in a position to grasp a lot. The transitional changes of a teenager to an adult is, by far, the most valuable lesson I have learnt. It doesn’t take much to hold your hold, and keep everything flowing the way it used. Its like sailing in a boat that already afloat. What’s hard, is to set sail to a new boat, get it to stop dwindling on the shallows, change the course of destination and let nothing stop your ambition. But maturity of mind does not come easily. You can’t just set your life before you, draft a plan and decide what part of it you are going to alter and what part you’ll leave as it is.

The only way their smears can have the desired effect is if they are lucky enough to be smearing a hyper-sensitive soul who reads everything written about them by their enemies on the internet and then seeks to address each and every smear - often on the forum on which it appeared, which will invariably be controlled by a hostile entity. This only encourages the keyboard warriors behind the hate campaign and makes their vile campaign of harrassment worthwhile.

It is not just about the war-time miracles being narrated; generally, the existence and survival of Israel is heavily attributed to a god’s miracle, conveniently ignoring the backing of foreign powers. There is an entire movie that discusses how the State of Israel was created against all odds; people of Jewish origin adopted it and with god on their side they turned the region “with 80% of desert, into the food and flower exporting country”. Maybe it is a way to absolve themselves of the atrocities they commit against the helpless population.
After a grueling day that started at 4 a.m. on Wednesday, I volunteered at Dress for Success in the evening. My 10-year-old daughter asked if she could volunteer with me. Carli has not accompanied me during my volunteer duties since she was a baby. I would spread out a blanket in the corner and she would sleep or play–but that was MANY years ago. Carli has always asked a lot of questions about what I do with the women while I volunteer. I believe it is good to instill a volunteering mindset while she is young. So, actually, I was thrilled that she wanted to join me!

And the last was Samantha Jane who is in 5th grade. I took care of her for the first few months of her life while her parents worked. It was so much fun to cuddle her and sing to her and do all the baby things. She used to climb on a chair reach my piano keyboard, punch a button for automatic play, and then dance to the music. She is now a very good soccer player. She was the child of Andy and Lori.

That wedding will be thirty years gone this July--so long ago that it qualifies as ancient history really. I guess I can write about how I was more closely involved than most now. And this week, when my old friend's son is getting married to the woman he loves with (not quite) all the fanfare and pomp that went with his parents' seems like the appropriate time to do so for the very first time. So you are getting a Royal Wedding Exclusive really--see, I never disappoint my loyal readers!

PetroLogistics will not receive any proceeds from the units sold by Propylene. The company said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it would use its net proceeds for working capital and general partnership purposes, for funding certain future capital expenditures at its propane dehydrogenation plant, including a portion of those associated with a planned maintenance project in 2013 to replace the reactor catalyst and for funding part of the distributions to common unitholders for the lost margin resulting from such action.

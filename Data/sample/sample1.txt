Wait, wait. I am aging digital humanist referred to in last tweet. Feeling ancient, 140 charaacters, lacked nuance. :) Sorry
I'm waiting for my invite from so I can finally see what everyone else is posting about!
Nicks opinion:
The rising share of young adults age 25 to 34 in the next 20 years is good news for the state, which experienced negative growth for that age group from 1990 to 2010, Myers said. Young adults are crucial for the state's economic growth. They are most likely to become new workers, rent their first apartment, buy a home, have children and be first-time voters, he said.

The $58 shellfish sampler is as outre an entree as you're likely to find in a Maryland restaurant. Is it meant to be shared? Composed of clams casino, oysters Rockefeller, a lobster tail with drawn butter and a spinach risotto with shrimp, crabs and mussels in garlic butter sauce, it has all been sourced and managed confidently and presented with elan. An 18-ounce cowboy steak, served Oscar style, is likewise an effective combination of a flamboyant dish prepared with precise care.
Check back for a post in the next few days---I will be posting some photos with light fixtures & paint on the walls!

What do you do with what you learn? Does it impact the development of the piece?
Brothers Nathan and Aaron Weaver conclude the black metal trilogy they started with their staggering 2007 album Two Hunters, and its a worthy, appropriately apocalyptic conclusion. Wolves In the Throne Room have always blended their black metal sturm-und-drang with conventionally pretty female vocals (here, as on Two Hunters, provided by Jessika Kenney), a droning experimental sensibility, and an interest in structure that allows them to alternate the more pummeling, blistering stretches (like the harrowing "Subterranean Initiation") with restrained and even beautiful moments. Sandwiched in between the slow-burn 12-minute opener "Thuja Magus Imperium" (which moves from serene Kenney vocals to room-clearing tumult) and the aforementioned "Subterranean Initiation" is a curious sound art miniature on which Isis vocalist Aaron Turner chants, accompanied by scraping metallic noises. Later, on the appropriately named "Woodland Cathedral," Kenney's voice soars and keens over pulsing waves of feedback and Kosmische synthesizer sweeps. The band continues to experiment with sounds and approaches that usually fall outside the black metal aesthetic, incorporating the repetitive minimalism of early 2000s post-rock and the hypnotic synth washes of Krautrock into their melancholic, desolate sound.

The submission was in bad shape in terms of its physical condition and its content. Granted, evaluating manuscripts is somewhat subjective, but there was nothing about this work someone might have valued. Specifically, it was so full of grammatical errors that it read like a bad translation. Also, there were some simple flaws in the manuscript (unintentional tense and P.O.V. shifts) that BB ought to have asked the writer to fix before submitting.

At Paragon, the oldest restaurant in the Pearl, general manager Bryan Westacott favors walk-in applicants. The comfort-food brasserie gets four to six job seekers a day dropping off résumés lately, Westacott said, up from one or two a day last year. And 70 percent have college degrees.
Roxanne and I started blogging within a few months of each other and I came across her blog when we were both newbies. As soon as I found her, I knew I had found something special. From that first visit to my most recent, I find that visiting River Garden Studio is more like visiting a magical place rather than a computer site. Roxanne fills each and every post with creativity, beauty, grace, and love. Roxanne and I have worked on a number of projects together and she is every bit as wonderful as her blog would suggest.

If you’ve been keeping an eye on Mochi Bytes, you know that I’ve been sharing a lot about WonderCon. We will be back to our regularly scheduled programming with other news, reviews, and events right after this. Believe me, I have a list of nerdy anime/video-game entries I’ve been dying to post. But before we bid a farewell to this year’s sister convention to SDCC, let us take a look back at the greatest cosplays, the best of show, if you will. After all, why should judges at the Saturday Masquerade be the only ones who get to decide which costumes rule supreme? We all have agency, nowadays. That’s what blogs are for.
Let’s put that figure in a global context.

We are used to terms like ChickLit and ChickFlick, and they usually seem to be more about who wouldn't like the work described rather than who would. Men are supposed to like thick bricks of books, with tinfoil on the covers, written by ex-SAS men or Navy SEALs, while for women something that hints of shopping (especially with shoes involved) is supposed to press the right buttons.
I learned through experience and on the job training. I wanted to be able to convey the basics then build lessons for more complex studio images. The book became somewhat of challenge but once I started it shaped up nicely.

In 1866, a variation on the usual theatrical spectacle debuted at Niblo's that soon proved to be his most popular offering. Plays had featured popular songs in the past, and variants of operas (or rather, sung plays or 'ballad-operas') were popular. But in September, The Black Crook debuted, with odd traits at the time that have now come to typify the modern musical.

This is the way the U.S. Army, in its RFP, describes the possible uses of the non-lethal UAV: “Potential commercial applications might include, but are not limited to: crowd control for local law enforcement; border protection for Homeland Security; or temporary incapacitation of non violent criminals for local SWAT teams and/or law enforcement.”

Unlike Facebook, where both parties have to agree to befriending each other, Twitter is more open. It’s perfectly possible to chat to people on a regular basis without mutual followage. Twitter offers the opportunity to directly contact people who may be Good To Know and who, shock horror, may become Proper Friends. The directness and ease of such contact is really not to be underestimated. As with all networking, though, it’s worth
